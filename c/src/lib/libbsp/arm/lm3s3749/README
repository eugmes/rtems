BSP for Texas Instruments LM3S3749 microcontroller

By default the MCU is configured to run from external 10 MHz oscillator.
Default core frequency is configured to 50 MHz. Both external oscillator
frequency and system frequency are configurable (see configure.in).

Default configuration enables UART0 at 115200 baud.

SSI support is available using libi2c. For now settings are hardcoded to
SPI mode with clock 1/50 of system clock frequency (1 MHz in for default
config). Any pin can be used as CS pin, it should be supplied as libi2c
address (use LM3S3749_GPIO_PIN from bsp/io.h). SSI support code does not
attempt to configure pins used as CS, this is responsibility of the user
application/driver.
